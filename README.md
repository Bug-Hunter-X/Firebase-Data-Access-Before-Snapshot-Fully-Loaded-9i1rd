This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase development: attempting to access data from a Firestore snapshot before it's fully loaded. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, resulting in an error when accessing document properties prematurely. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version, utilizing promises or async/await to ensure data is available before access.
