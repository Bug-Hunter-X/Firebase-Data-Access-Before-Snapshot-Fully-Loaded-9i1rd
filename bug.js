The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has fully loaded. This often happens when you attempt to read data from a listener before it has received the initial data. For example, if you have a listener that attaches immediately and then tries to use data from the snapshot, the data may not have arrived yet, causing a null pointer exception or similar error.  Another example is trying to access a subcollection or nested field before verifying its existence.
